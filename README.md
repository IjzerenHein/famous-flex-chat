## Content

-	[Source code](./src/main.js)


## Build

To build the demo, make sure grunt, webpack and webpack-dev-server are installed globally:

```
npm install -g grunt
npm install -g webpack
npm install -g webpack-dev-server
```

Run npm to install all dev-dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To build the output (dist-folder), run the webpack command:

```
webpack
```


## Running

To run the demo either open `dist/index.html`

Or use the live-reload server:

```
grunt serve
```

As default Firebase is used as a backend server and connects to a ready made demo database. To set up your own database quickly, register as a new user on firebase.com and create a new free app. Then change this line in main.js to your database. 

```
fbMessages = new Firebase('https://famous-flex-chat.firebaseio.com/messages');
```
to 

```
fbMessages = new Firebase('https://<your-app-name>.firebaseio.com/messages');
```

That's it and that's that. Your chat page should now be empty and ready to be filled up with new messages.
