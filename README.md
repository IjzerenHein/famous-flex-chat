## Content

-	[Source code](./src/main.js)


## Build

To build the demo, make sure grunt, webpack and webpack-dev-server are installed globally:

```
npm install -g grunt
npm install -g webpack
npm install -g webpack-dev-server
```

Run npm to install all dev-dependencies:

```
npm install
```

To build the output (dist-folder), run the webpack command:

```
webpack
```


## Running

To run the demo either open `dist/index.html`

Or use the live-reload server:

```
grunt serve
```

The app uses Firebase as backend. A demo Firebase instance is hardcoded in main.js. 
To use your own database, register as a new user on Firebase.com and create a new free app and give it a name. Then change the firebase URL in main.js from:

```
fbMessages = new Firebase('https://famous-flex-chat.firebaseio.com/messages');
```
to this where &lt;your-app-name&gt; is the name of you Firebase app:

```
fbMessages = new Firebase('https://<your-app-name>.firebaseio.com/messages');
```

The chat should now be empty and ready for new messages. No additonal steps necessary.
